## Product Vision Statement

In the current internet age there is a incomprehensible and immense amount of interesting content to peruse yet theres little time to read or consume in the moment upon encountering something new to read, and its liable to be forgotten. **Fieldnotes** is a mobile web app that can be used to save articles, podcasts, youtube videos to be resurfaced for later (optional offline) reading and annotating.

## How this project came to be

After the shutdown of the FOSS project Omnivore, we found ourselves searching for a tool that could truly respect both our reading habits and our data. That search quickly turned into a desire to build our own **FOSS “read it later” app**—not just as a replacement, but as a way to preserve the philosophy behind these tools: empowering readers to **capture, curate, and revisit** meaningful content on their own terms. Read-it-later apps have always existed at the intersection of **attention, agency, and knowledge management**, helping people reclaim the web from the endless scroll. For more reading on the power of the read-it-later app, check out [this article](https://medium.com/praxis-blog/the-secret-power-of-read-it-later-apps-6c75cc37ef42) by Tiago Forte, one of the most prominent experts on productivity in our highly distractable and overwhelming digital age.
Therefore for our  
[Agile Software Development and DevOps](https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/agile-development-and-devops/syllabus/) course taught at NYU by [Professor Amos Bloomberg](https://knowledge.kitchen/me/cv/), we decided to work on **Fieldnotes**. We hope that our project proves as useful to you in actively, and thoughfully reading in the face of the immense information landscape of the digital age.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v18.x or higher
- npm
- MongoDB Atlas account (for production) or use mock data mode

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Both back-end and front-end can be started with `npm start`:

**Back-End:**
```bash
cd back-end
npm install
npm start    # Runs in development mode by default
```

**Front-End:**
```bash
cd front-end
npm install
npm start    # Starts Vite dev server with HMR
```

This is the recommended setup for both **development** and **deployment**.

### Detailed Setup

#### Back-End Setup

1. Navigate to the back-end directory:
   ```bash
   cd back-end
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret
   - See [back-end/README.md](back-end/README.md) for detailed configuration

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start              # Standard start (development mode by default)
   npm run dev            # Development with auto-restart
   NODE_ENV=production npm start  # Production mode
   ```

5. The back-end runs on `http://localhost:7001` by default.

**Environment Modes:**
- `development` (default) - Local development with detailed logging
- `production` - Deployment mode (set via `NODE_ENV=production`)
- `test` - Automatically used during test runs

#### Front-End Setup

1. Navigate to the front-end directory:
   ```bash
   cd front-end
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start         # Starts Vite dev server
   npm run dev       # Same as npm start
   npm run build     # Build for production
   npm run preview   # Preview production build
   ```

4. The front-end runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Server does not start**
- Check if all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Verify `.env` file exists in `/back-end/` directory
- Ensure port 7001 is not already in use

**API requests fail with CORS errors**
- Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in `.env` matches your front-end URL
- Check that both servers are running (backend: 7001, frontend: 5173/5174)
- Restart both servers after changing CORS configuration

**Tests fail unexpectedly**
- Run `npm run verify:integrity` to check DAO layer
- Ensure you're in the `/back-end/` directory when running tests
- Check that mock data files exist in `/back-end/data/`

**Front-end cannot connect to backend**
- Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:7001/health`
- Check API base URL in `/front-end/src/services/api.js`
- Ensure no firewall is blocking port 7001

**Database connection issues**
- Verify `MONGODB_URI` in `.env` file is correct
- Check MongoDB Atlas cluster is running and accessible
- Test connection: MongoDB connection status shown at `/health` endpoint
- Fallback to mock data: set `USE_MOCK_DB=true` in `.env`

**Authentication errors**
- Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set in `.env` file
- Check token expiration with `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` setting
- Verify user credentials are correct for login/registration

## Docker Deployment (Extra Credit)

This project includes full Docker containerization with Continuous Deployment support.

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Build and run all services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost
   - Backend API: http://localhost:7001
   - Health Check: http://localhost:7001/health

3. **View logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

4. **Stop services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

**Note**: The project includes two Docker Compose files:
- `docker-compose.yml` - For local development (builds images from source)
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - For production deployment (uses pre-built images from Docker Hub)

### Environment Variables

**For Docker deployment:**
- Create `.env` in the **root directory** (where docker-compose.yml is located)
- Docker Compose reads this file to pass environment variables to containers
- See `.env.example` in the root for the template

**For non-Docker local development:**
- Create `.env` in the **back-end directory** (`back-end/.env`)
- Node.js loads this when running `npm start` in the back-end folder
- The front-end doesn't need a separate `.env` (uses Vite proxy in development)

### What's Included

- ✅ **Docker Containerization**: Separate containers for frontend and backend
- ✅ **Multi-stage Builds**: Optimized frontend build with Nginx
- ✅ **Docker Compose**: Orchestration of all services
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Health checks, restart policies, and optimized images
- ✅ **Continuous Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment


### ✅ Core Requirements Met
- **✅ No credentials in version control** - All sensitive data is stored in `.env` files (excluded from git)
- **✅ Live front-end link** - Prominently featured in this README

### 🏆 Extra Credit Features Implemented
- **✅ Docker containerization** - Full Docker setup with multi-stage builds and Docker Compose orchestration
- **✅ Continuous Integration** - GitHub Actions runs tests on every push/PR

### 📋 Environment Variables
All required `.env` files have been submitted to administrators via the team messenger channel as instructed.
